## About ORIGYN

What if we could evolve industries to re-think ownership, value and commerce? Create new revenue streams? Power uncharted creative possibilities? Protect culturally and historically significant creations for the benefit of everyone? And what if we could do this—and more—using technology to deliver open, tamperproof, secure and transparently governed platforms? At ORIGYN Foundation, we’re developing all of this and more, including the tools and technologies to preserve the creations that define human ingenuity.

## Department

The Engineering department is responsible for creating and maintaining technologies and solutions including smart contracts (canisters), web and mobile applications, system integrations and machine learning models that power the ORIGYN protocol within the Internet Computer (DFINITY).

## Recruiting Needs

ORIGYN is looking to build a global team in at least two Development Centers - Slovakia and Mexico. We’re looking to build “pods” (scrum teams) that will complete various project and roadmap objectives. In each country, we prefer for resources to be located in the Development Centers (resources in a particular city); however, we are open to remote workers provided that the remote resources can travel to the Center periodically.

#### Initial hiring wave

To expedite the process, we are initially looking to hire contractors with a potential ability to employ them as full time employees (once the legal entities in each country are established).

**Terms:**
The contracts will be for 6 - 12 month with mutual termination clauses.

**Timing:**
ORIGYN is looking to fill all positions in each POD as soon as practical. PODs can begin operation with the first hired resource without the need to wait for the remainder of resources.

#### Partner Arrangements

We are seeking organizations or individuals who can fulfill either of below roles:

- **Recruiters**

  - Recruiters who can find candidates who we can hire directly as independent contractors.
  - In this model we would pay agencies a flat fee per hired resource after the 4th week of successful “employment”
  - Should the resource resign or be terminated within 4 months, the recruiter will “replace” the resource at no cost.
  - ORIGYN will contract with each resource individually

- **Agencies**
  - Agencies who are willing to provide one or more resources on an hourly basis
  - Agencies find and staff the resources (pending ORIGYN’s approval)
  - Agencies invoice the company on a monthly basis at a designated rate \* the hours spent on ORIGYN’s projects for every resource
  - Agencies are transparent with ORIGYN regarding the hourly rate paid to the resource and the hourly markup they charge
  - After 12 months, ORIGYN can hire each resource as a full time employee without a penalty.
  - ORIGYN treats each resource as a dedicated resource and the agency’s role is solely to facilitate payments and fulfill any local employment obligations.
