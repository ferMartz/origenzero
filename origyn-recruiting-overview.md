## About ORIGYN

What if we could evolve industries to re-think ownership, value and commerce? Create new revenue streams? Power uncharted creative possibilities? Protect culturally and historically significant creations for the benefit of everyone? And what if we could do this—and more—using technology to deliver open, tamperproof, secure and transparently governed platforms? At ORIGYN Foundation, we’re developing all of this and more, including the tools and technologies to preserve the creations that define human ingenuity.

## Department

The Engineering department is responsible for creating and maintaining technologies and solutions including smart contracts (canisters), web and mobile applications, system integrations and machine learning models that power the ORIGYN protocol within the Internet Computer (DFINITY).

## Recruiting Needs

ORIGYN is looking to build a global team in at least two Development Centers - Slovakia and Mexico. We’re looking to build “pods” (scrum teams) that will complete various project and roadmap objectives. In each country, we prefer for resources to be located in the Development Centers (resources in a particular city); however, we are open to remote workers provided that the remote resources can travel to the Center periodically.

#### Initial hiring wave

To expedite the process, we are initially looking to hire contractors with a potential ability to employ them as full time employees (once the legal entities in each country are established).

**Terms:**
The contracts will be for 6 - 12 month with mutual termination clauses.

**Timing:**
ORIGYN is looking to fill all positions in each POD as soon as practical. PODs can begin operation with the first hired resource without the need to wait for the remainder of resources.
