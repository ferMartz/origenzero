# ORIGYN - Recruiting Overview

## About ORIGYN

What if we could evolve industries to re-think ownership, value and commerce? Create new revenue streams? Power uncharted creative possibilities? Protect culturally and historically significant creations for the benefit of everyone? And what if we could do this—and more—using technology to deliver open, tamperproof, secure and transparently governed platforms? At ORIGYN Foundation, we’re developing all of this and more, including the tools and technologies to preserve the creations that define human ingenuity.

## Department

The Engineering department is responsible for creating and maintaining technologies and solutions including smart contracts (canisters), web and mobile applications, system integrations and machine learning models that power the ORIGYN protocol within the Internet Computer (DFINITY).
