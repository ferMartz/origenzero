## About The Project

The purpose of this project is to assemble a team of developers in México.

Here's why:

- Full support of a team member for hiring developers and open an office
- Great pool of talented developers in México
- Contacts with local staffing agencies, developers, other developer teams, legal offices, etc
- It makes financial sense in terms of developer hourly rates
- Timezones are very similiar to United States
- Flights from many US cities to México are 1-3 hours duration
